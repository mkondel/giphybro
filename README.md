# Tech

## UI
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

[React](https://reactjs.org/)

[Infinite Scroll](https://github.com/danbovey/react-infinite-scroller)

[Focus Trap](https://github.com/focus-trap/focus-trap-react)

## Hosting
Github using [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages).

## Details
- The current app is completely serverless, it could have been implemented in plain create-react-app. Next.js gives me a running start with its boilerplate, but it will also handle API and SSR when that's needed.
- Infinite scroll lib is utilized for its eponymous behavior.
- Focus trap allows constant keyboard input w/o a visible text box.

# Trade-offs

# Time
- Next.js, gh-pages setup, deploying successfully: 3hr
- Infinite scroll: 2hr
- Focus trap and the invisible text input: 2hr
- Styling and UI: 3hr
- Giphy API: 2hr
- TOTAL: 12hr
